# Ulyu Monitoring System
Ums (ulyu monitoring system) is a system allowing to display in real time the temperature, voltage and frequency sensors of a computer on a screen coupled to an arduino.
Ums works with Open Hradware Monitor and a python program. It's able to controlling a simple rgb led strip (the color will be the same over the entire length) with a very simple but functional control panel.
In my case, I am not using aduino but directly the ATMega328p chip on a pcb (The components around the chip and the FTDI (the red plate between the USB and the circuit) will not necessary if you only used one arduino and two 16x2 screens)

# Required components :
- [2] 16x2 lcd arduino display
- [2] 50Kohms potentiometer
- (Optional) RGB strip with the controller
- Arduino (all version work)
  OR
  Atmega328p (the chip i'm using) with
    - [2] 22pf capacitor
    - 10Kohms resistor
    - 16Mhz quartz
    - FTDI board for usb interface

# Schematics :

/!\ Ground and vcc of the lcd aren't connected to the arduino but they must be !

With the ATMega328p the circuit is the same but you need to connect the FTDI board to Reset, RX and TX

/!\ If you wand to use the color controller, red is connected to pin 11, green to pin 12 and blue to pin 13 but you can easily change it in the arduino code

# Utilization :

- 1: Connect arduino to pc
- 2: televerse arduino code (ums_arduino/ums.ino)
- 3: Install all the python librairies  (Install part)
- 4: Edit the python program (ums_python/ums.py)
- 5: Locate "output = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600, timeout=.7)" and change 'COM3' by the port your arduino is curently using
- 6: Save program
- 7: Open OpenHradwareMonitor (download it from https://openhardwaremonitor.org/files/openhardwaremonitor-v0.9.1.zip)
- 8: Open python program
- 9: Done ! you cane now change strip's color (the window must remain open otherwise the arduino will disonnect)

# Install python librairies

Python download : https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install the following librairies by W+R > cmd > type the following command

- Tkinter : **python -m pip install tkinter**
- Serial : **python -m pip install pyserial**
- Time : **python -m pip install time**
- wmi : **python -m pip install wmi**
- pywin32 : **python -m pip install pywin32** (restart computer)

# Coming soon for v1.1

- .exe version to no longer need python and all of its libraries
- Com port change in the UI
- windowed UI
